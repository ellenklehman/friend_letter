  <h1>Hello From Australia</h1>
  <p>Dear <%= @friend %>,</p>
  <p>How are you doing? I have been having the best time exploring the rainforests of Australia.  Tomorrow I am planning on snorkeling at the Great Barrier Reef! I have brought my coding practice with me, so I don't forget all that I have learned so far.</p>
  <p><%= @friend %>, you would not believe how beautiful it is here. You should come with me next time. I can't wait to move here and write code on the beach! </p>
  <p>Looking forward to seeing you soon. I'll bring you back a souvenir. </p>
  <p>Cheers,</p>
  <p>Coding and Travel Enthusiast Jane</p>
